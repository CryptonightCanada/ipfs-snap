  IPFS combines good ideas from Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia, SFS, and the Web.
  It is like a single bittorrent swarm, exchanging git objects. IPFS provides
  an interface as simple as the HTTP web, but with permanence built in. You
  can also mount the world at /ipfs.

grade: devel # must be 'stable' to release into candidate/stable channels
confinement: devmode # use 'strict' once you have the right plugs and slots

architectures:
  - build-on: [amd64, i386, arm64]

apps:
  ipfs:
    command: ipfs
    plugs: [home, network, network-bind, removable-media]

    # our zip files for i386 are labelled as `386` rather than `i386` so this is a workaround to pick the right url.
    # ...also the only var that you get with the arch in it is the `$SNAPCRAFT_ARCH_TRIPLET` which doesn't give the same values as the snapcraft yaml arch selector
